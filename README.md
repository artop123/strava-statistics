## What is different

* FTP is now calculated automatically from your activities. Each activity now displays its calculated eFTP
* FTP chart has been replaced with estimated FTP, showing different FTP values for running and cycling
* Activity intensity is determined based on estimated FTP
* Activities are sortable by FTP and best power outputs
* Weight can be imported [from a json file](#weightjson)
* Weight history chart is displayed if there is atleast five measurements
* And some other minor fixes ðŸ‘€

### weight.json

The weight can be imported from a JSON file. For example, the [WithingsToGarminSync](https://github.com/artop123/withings-to-garmin-sync) outputs ```withings.json```, which can be modified to the correct format using ```jq```

```bash
jq 'map(select(.Weight > 0) | {(.Date[0:10]): (.Weight * 100 | round / 100)}) | add' /path/to/withings.json > ./storage/weight.json
```

You can use ```crontab -e``` to schedule this.
